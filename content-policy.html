      <h2>Policies for Content Posted by Users on Qeeda</h2>
      <p>
        The policies below play an important role in maintaining a positive and informative
        experience for everyone using Qeeda Contest featuring content posted by users. If we find
        content or behavior that violates these policies, we’ll respond appropriately, including
        potentially removing that content or terminating account privileges. We may also make
        exceptions to these policies based on artistic, educational, historical, documentary, or
        scientific considerations, or where there are other substantial benefits to the public.

        We’ll do our best to prevent poor quality content from ever appearing on Qeeda Contest
        featuring content posted by users, but if you do see something that violates one of our
        policies, please report it
        at support@qeedagame.com. We appreciate your help in keeping our products safe and helpful for everyone.
      </p>

      <h3>CSAI &amp; Pedophilia</h3>
      <p>
        We have zero tolerance towards content that sexually exploits children. This includes all
        child sexual abuse imagery (even cartoon images). We’ll remove and report such content as
        required by law, and we may also take other appropriate action, such as disabling accounts
        and terminating access to all contents within an account.
      </p>

      <h3>Non-Consensual Explicit Imagery</h3>
      <p>
        We honor requests from users to remove nude or sexually explicit text, images and videos shared
        without their consent (often referred to as “revenge porn”). Contact at support@qeedagame.com for more
        information and to request content removal.
      </p>

      <h3>Involuntary Fake Pornography</h3>
      <p>
        We honor requests from users to remove fake images and videos that falsely depict them nude
        or in a sexually explicit situation, and that were distributed without their consent. Contact at support@qeedagame.com for more
        information and to request content removal.
      </p>

      <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
      <p>
        Upon request, we’ll remove personal information if we believe it could lead to a specific
        harm, such as identity theft or financial fraud. This includes sensitive government ID
        numbers such as U.S. Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers,
        images of signatures and personal health documents. In cases where this information is
        broadly available, like national ID numbers listed on a government website, we generally
        don’t process removals. We sometimes refuse requests if we believe someone is attempting to
        abuse these policies to remove other information from our results.
      </p>

      <h3>Spam</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow spam, which may include unwanted, irrelevant, promotional or commercial
        content, content that is created by an automated program, repetitive content, or anything
        that appears to be a mass solicitation.
      </p>

      <h3>Malware &amp; Phishing</h3>
      <p>
        Links to malware, viruses, or other harmful software aren’t permitted. We don't allow
        phishing or other content that harms or interferes with the operation of the networks,
        servers, or other infrastructure of Qeeda or others. 
      </p>

      <h3>Valid Legal Requests</h3>
      <p>
        Upon request, we’ll sometimes remove content under applicable laws or in response to a court
        order. Submit legal requests at support@qeedagame.com.
      </p>

      <h3>Violence &amp; Gore</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be shocking,
        sensational, or gratuitous.
      </p>

      <h3>Sexually Explicit Content</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow content that contains nudity, graphic sex acts, or sexually explicit
        material. Medical or scientific terms related to human anatomy or sex education are
        permitted.
      </p>

      <h3>Vulgar Language &amp; Profanity</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow obscenities, profanities, or nonsensical content that carry no actual
        meaning.
      </p>

      <h3>Hate Speech</h3>
      <p>
        Our products are platforms for free expression, but we don’t permit hate speech. Hate speech
        is content that promotes or condones violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting
        hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion,
        disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity,
        or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or
        marginalization.
      </p>

      <h3>Harassment</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow harassment, bullying, or threatening behavior, and we don’t allow this
        service to be used to engage in these activities. Anyone using this service to single
        someone out for malicious abuse, threaten someone with serious harm, sexualize someone in an
        unwanted way, expose private information of someone else that could be used to carry out
        threats, disparage or belittle victims of violence or tragedy, deny an atrocity, direct a
        personal ad hominem attack against a private person or organization, or harass in other ways
        may have the offending content removed or be permanently banned from using the service. We
        also may refer threats of harm and other dangerous situations to law enforcement. Keep in
        mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have serious offline
        consequences for both the harasser and the victim.
      </p>

      <h3>Dangerous Content</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow this service to be used to engage in illegal activities or to promote goods,
        services, or information that facilitates or causes serious and immediate harm to other
        people or animals. While we permit general information for educational purposes about this
        content, we draw the line when the content directly facilitates harm.
      </p>

      <h3>Terrorist Content</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t permit terrorist organizations to use this service for any purpose, including
        recruitment. We’ll also remove content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes
        terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks.
      </p>

      <h3>Advertisement</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t allow content that advertises products or services, including direct calls to
        purchase, links to other websites, company contact information, and other promotional
        tactics. We don’t allow sponsored content that’s concealed or misrepresented as independent
        content.
      </p>

      <h3>Misrepresentation</h3>
      <p>
        We’ll remove content and may take account action on users who attempt to impersonate another
        person or organization, or otherwise engage in activities intended to deceive, defraud, or
        mislead others. This includes falsely implying affiliation with, or endorsement by, another
        individual or organization. This also includes  using multiple accounts to evade our
        policies, bypass blocks,  or otherwise subvert restrictions placed on your account.
      </p>

      <h3>Copyrighted Content</h3>
      <p>
        Be aware of rules for photos and video when at events. We will respond to clear notices of
        alleged copyright infringement. Repeated infringement of intellectual property rights,
        including copyright, will result in account termination.
      </p>

      <h3>Irrelevant Content</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to remove content that’s off-topic.
      </p>

      <h3>Medical Topics</h3>
      <p>
        When we highlight information on medical topics across Qeeda Contests, we strive to show information
        that reflects scientific consensus and evidence-based best practices, since we consider this
        content high-quality. To this end, if this highlighted information is not supported by
        general scientific consensus, we reserve the right to correct or remove the information from
        the feature. Finally, please note that this service is purely informative and should not be
        used to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, or provide medical or counseling
        care.
